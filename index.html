      </li>
      <li><a href="./00_blending/">00_blending</a><br>
        Basic demo that demonstrates Alpha-Blending. The scene contains a floor and 3 quads with transparency. 
        The blending function can be changed interactively.
      </li>
      <li><a href="./00_texturing/">00_texturing</a><br>
        Basic demo that shows a scene with models and a floor with textures. Textures and the model can be changed.
        Texture filtering techniques (i.e., mipmapping and anisotropic filtering) are demonstrated.
